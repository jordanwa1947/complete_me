# DTR Memo
## Project:  CompleteMe
## Group Member Names:  
* Silvestre Cuellar
* Jordan Whitten
* Michael Gatewood
## Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
* Silvestre: Learn about trie structure, how to manipulate different data structures
* Jordan: Learn as much as possible about everything in the universe
* Michael: Be able to speak intelligently about trie data structures

## Goals and expectations:  
Complete all features of iteration 4; all members will contribute; all members can speak to every line of code

## Team strengths: 
Conflict resolution, problem-solving, project management

## How to overcome obstacles:  
Collaborate and compromise

## Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):  
Friday night: Independent study (Michael’s “family night”)
Saturday: Work together at Turing 9-4; work independently in evening
Sunday: Work independently if/when possible; come together as necessary
Next week: Daily retro after class; work through challenges together; divide and conquer

## Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):
We will retro daily to resolve obstacles and challenges.  Prior to breaking into independent work, all members will have a solid understanding of goals and expectations.  Ongoing communication will be facilitated using Slack and text messages when working independently.

## Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
Silvestre: Ruby/OOP, git; wants to understand and be able to articulate the project
Jordan: Ruby code; problem-solving in code; wants to better understand recursion in order to apply to future challenges; better understanding of trie data structure
Michael: TDD and git are strengths; seeks to be able to better articulate how a prefix trie works and is implemented

#Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
Silvestre: 
Jordan: 
Michael: Wants to build a GUI connecting Ruby

## Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
* Use branches appropriately and never push to master branch
* Do not merge your own pull request
* Resolve merge conflicts as a group
* Use micro commits and make pull request when a feature is working
* Use GitHub Issues to create and assign tasks

## Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:  
Be respectful, but be direct

## Agenda to discuss project launch:

### Ideas:  
Friday night: file structure, 

### Tools:  
Git/GitHub; GitHub Issues; Slack; Google

### Additional Notes:
